# Calculator
For the final project of the fundamentals portion of the Odin Project, a calculator was designed using Vanilla JS.

It can display the input value and calculated value at the top display and it supports keyboard input for numbers, operators (+,-,* and /), clear (escape key) and calculate button (enter key). 

The layout is designed using CSS grid system.
